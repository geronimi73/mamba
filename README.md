# finetune.py

This code is setting up and executing a training process for a üêç [mamba](https://github.com/state-spaces/mamba) using PyTorch, Hugging Face's Transformers, Accelerate, and W&B (Weights & Biases). Here's a breakdown of the key components and steps:

1. **Imports and Initial Setup**: The script imports necessary libraries and modules such as PyTorch, Transformers, Accelerate, and W&B. It also imports a specific model (`MambaLMHeadModel`) from `mamba_ssm.models.mixer_seq_simple`.

2. **Accelerator and W&B Initialization**: The `Accelerator` is initialized for distributed and mixed precision training, and W&B (a tool for tracking and visualizing machine learning experiments) is initialized in a disabled mode.

3. **Model Loading and Modification**:
    - **Model Path and Loading**: The model is loaded from a specified path using the `MambaLMHeadModel.from_pretrained` method.
    - **Monkey Patching `forward` Method**: The `forward` method of the model is modified (monkey patched) to include a custom loss function using cross-entropy loss. This modification allows the model to compute loss if labels are provided.
    - **Tokenizer Initialization**: A tokenizer (`AutoTokenizer`) is loaded and configured with padding and end-of-sequence tokens.

4. **Token Embeddings Update**: The token embeddings in the model are resized to accommodate additional tokens and special tokens added to the tokenizer.

5. **Dataset Preparation**:
    - **Loading Dataset**: A dataset is loaded from a specified source.
    - **Tokenization**: The dataset is tokenized using the prepared tokenizer. The `tokenize` function processes text into a format suitable for the model.
    - **Multithreading**: Tokenization is done in a multithreaded manner using `os.cpu_count()` to utilize all available CPU cores.

6. **Data Collation**: A `collate` function is defined to transform a list of tokenized elements into a format suitable for batch processing during training.

7. **Training Configuration**:
    - **Batch Size, Gradient Accumulation, and Learning Rate**: Key hyperparameters for training, such as batch size, gradient accumulation steps, and learning rate, are set.
    - **TrainingArguments**: The `TrainingArguments` class from Hugging Face is used to configure various aspects of training like batch sizes, logging, evaluation strategy, and learning rate scheduler.

8. **Trainer Setup**: A `Trainer` object is created with the model, tokenizer, training arguments, data collator, and datasets for training and evaluation.

9. **Model Training**: Finally, the model is trained using the `Trainer.train()` method.

Overall, the script is a comprehensive setup for training a large language model (MambaLMHeadModel) with specific configurations and customizations for tokenization, data collation, and training arguments.
